## Setup Guide
*Pre-requisites: git, python 2.7.X, virtualenv, pip (7.1.X recommended)* 

* If you're using Ubuntu, here are all the packages you'll need before you can
  proceed

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-dev build-essential curl libatlas-base-dev gfortran
  $ sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev
  ```

* Clone the repo from GitHub

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/rouseguy/intro2deeplearning.git
    $ cd intro2deeplearning
    ```

* Create python virtual environment
    ```    
    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    ```    

* Upgrade pip
   ```
   $ pip install -U pip
   ```

* Install requirements using pip

    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Use `requirements_linux.txt` instead of `requirements.txt` if you're on
    linux

* When the requirements are being downloaded / installed, Fetch the datasets
  simultaneously

    ```
    $ sh download_data.sh
    ```

* Run **check_env.py** script to test the dependencies

    ```
    $ python check_env.py
    ```
    
    Output should look like this
    
    ```
    [ OK ] scipy version 0.15.1
    [ OK ] PIL version 1.1.7
    [ OK ] keras
    [ OK ] IPython version 4.0.0
    [ OK ] theano version 0.7.0
    [ OK ] numpy version 1.9.2
    [ OK ] pandas version 0.16.2
    [ OK ] gensim version 0.10.3
    [ OK ] sklearn version 0.16.1
    ```
    
    This means you have all the dependencies installed and you're ready to start.
  

* Run the notebook
    
    ```
    $ cd notebooks
    $ ipython notebook
    ```
    This opens your default browser which displays the list of notebooks in the
    current directory. 
    
    Open **1. Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks.ipynb**.
    Now, run the first cell with imports in the notebook (shift + enter).
    If you have all the dependencies installed, this should run without any
    errors.
    
**_Note: We only support Ubuntu Linux (Tested) & OSX environments. We strongly
recommend Windows users to have a VM running Linux, and then install these
requirements on that VM._**
